Brief summary of a few books I read and found interesting for it to be shared. This writing is based of personal opinions. 

### 1. Self Leadership and the One Minute Manager Increasing Effectiveness Through Situational Self Leadership

#### Author(s) : Ken Blanchard, Susan Fowler, Laurence Hawkins

This book is part of the One Minute manager book series. It goes by the tag line "Increasing Effectiveness Through Situational Self Leadership", and thats
basically self explanatory on what the book covers. I am not much in to self help books because when reading its seems so obvious that our life could be made
so easier but it reality things do not always work out the same. But it was a good read and I try to sub-conciously follow and relate the advices given
in this book.

The book follows a story to create a scenario for the readers to understand the message clearly. It starts of with Steve, the protagonist, finding himself at
a difficult situation in his career. Seeing no escape from imminent termination, he starts blaming his manager, co-workers right when he meet another character, Cayla, 
who appears to have all the answers to his questions and leads him to become a better leader. They focus three main points of self leadership:
#### 1. Challenge Assumed Constraints 

"An Assumed Constraint Is A Belief You Have, Based On Past Experience, That Limits Your Current And Future Experiences." 
It is basically those tasks that we find difficult to start ony because of a bad experience with something similar. One can't simply predict an outcome
without proceeding with the discussion. It better to discussion over the requirements, findings and ask for help is required. The writer uses the classic example 
of elephant thinking where an adult elephant tends to ignore and believe its impossible for it to break the chain it has been tied to since childhood.  

#### 2. Celebrate Your Points of Power


#### 3. Collaborate for Success

### 2. Dopamine Detox

#### Author(s) : Thibaut Meurisse

### 3. Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life

#### Author(s) : Hector Garcia and Francesc Miralles

### 4. The New One Minute Manager

#### Author(s) : Ken Blanchard & Spencer Johnson

One Minute Goals

This book is very specific to its message. It is a good read but I have doubts that it will work on all work cultures around the world, but nonetheless, managers (non-micromanagers!) could make an effort to try out the points mentioned. This book is an adaptable of The One Minute Manager, published back in 1986. Since then, the work culture has changed so much, which is why I think the writers adjusted/tweaked their primary message(s) a bit. 

There are three main goal which the New One Minute manager follows. First each of them are explained what they are, and in the latter part of the book, the writer explains why each of them work. 

#### One Minute Goals

This is the time when the manager spends most time for effective planning. The better the planning, the easier the execution.

- Plan together with the manager and define goals clearly.
- Have due dates for each goals, because without a deadline there's no closure.
- Review the progress regularly
- Encourage people for their efforts 
- If it seems the goal will not be accomplished, improvise, sit with them, find the issue and adapt.

The example used to explain this is too abstract, which is understandable so that readers from different professionals can picture themselves in their way of thinking. But, I think a specific problem could have been used regardless of the profession, as readers are smart enough to understand the message. 

#### One Minute Praisings

Quote from chapter
> Help People Reach Their Full Potential. Catch Them Doing Something Right.
> thing to do to help people become winners is to catch them doing something _approximately_ right in the beginning. Then you move on toward the desired result.

- Praise people for their work and let them know for what they did right.
- Pause and allow them to feel good! (I know a bit weird!)
- Encourage them to do more good.

#### One Minute Re-Directs

Quote from chapter
> "Now, everybody needs to be a learner because things are changing so much. Even if I'm an expert, the next day my area might be eliminated..."

This 'One Minute Re-Direct' comes when there's a mistake. I personally liked this concept. You have to have a clear goal set first. The manager this comes up with the mistake, which has to be specific and the possible impact of the results. Then, a pause to let the employee absorb the message. And then remind them that they are better then the mistake and he has confidence on them and so on. So, in short, bring in the bad news, let it sink, then remind they are better than this. 

Most companies do the performance review once a year. Till then the employee has no idea how they are performing. Only thing that keeps them driving is the salary at the end of the month. If their mistakes are reviewed regularly and they have the attitude to improve after each redirect, both parties are benefitted. 

- Re-direct people as soon as possible
- Review the mistake together and clarify the impact of the mistake
- Pause and let them realize
- Remind them they are better than the mistake. 

### 5. The Psychology of Money
