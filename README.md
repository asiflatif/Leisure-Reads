Brief summary of a few books I read and found interesting for it to be shared. This writing is based of personal opinions. 

### 1. Self Leadership and the One Minute Manager Increasing Effectiveness Through Situational Self Leadership

#### Author(s) : Ken Blanchard, Susan Fowler, Laurence Hawkins

This book is part of the One Minute manager book series. It goes by the tag line "Increasing Effectiveness Through Situational Self Leadership", and thats
basically self explanatory on what the book covers. I am not much in to self help books because when reading its seems so obvious that our life could be made
so easier but it reality things do not always work out the same. But it was a good read and I try to sub-conciously follow and relate the advices given
in this book.

The book follows a story to create a scenario for the readers to understand the message clearly. It starts of with Steve, the protagnist, finding himself at
a difficult situation in his career. Seeing no escape from imminent termination, he starts blaming his manager, co-workers right when he meet anothr character, Cayla, 
who appears to have all the answers to his questions and leads him to become a better leader. They focus three main points of self leadership:
#### 1. Challenge Assumed Constraints 

"An Assumed Constraint Is A Belief You Have, Based On Past Experience, That Limits Your Current And Future Experiences." 
It is basically those tasks that we find difficult to start ony because of a bad experience with something similar. One can't simply predict an outcome
without proceeding with the discussion. It better to discussion over the requirements, findings and ask for help is required. The writer uses the classic example 
of elephant thinking where an adult elephant tends to ignore and believe its impossible for it to break the chain it has been tied to since childhood.  

#### 2. Celebrate Your Points of Power


#### 3. Collaborate for Success
